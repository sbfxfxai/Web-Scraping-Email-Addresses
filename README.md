Web Scraping Email Addresses
This code uses the Scrapy library to parse the website and find all links containing the keywords. It also includes a delay between requests, a more specific regular expression to match email addresses, and a set to store the email addresses. The code also includes error handling to handle cases where the website cannot be accessed or if the website structure changes.
